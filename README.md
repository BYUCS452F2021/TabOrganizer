# Tab Organizer

This will solve the problem of never wanting to close your tabs because you'll need it later but not right now. We will create a browser extension with an interface to organize browser tabs into folders of the user's choosing. At the click of a button all the tabs you currently have open are stored in a new folder. On clicking a folder every url in that folder is opened in your window.

We have 5 people so this project is full.
